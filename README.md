# Sealion detection and classification

The purpose of this code is detecting sealions on the image and classify it.

This code was used for [NOAA sealion competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-fisheries-steller-sea-lion-population-count) in KAGGLE and final result is **58th**.

### Prerequisites

Hardware
```
Nvidia GPU with at least 3GB memory
```
Interpreter and Operating System
```
Python version 2.7 or 3.5
Tested on UBUNTU 16.04 and Windows
```
Dependency
```
tensorflow-gpu
python-opencv
imgaug
numpy
csv
skimage
```
### Installing and demo

You have to download this repository and also pre-trained model.

```
pre-trained model download link : https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwaxr_eelTFyS0Vyc2NfajJNb1E
```
You have to depress the 'sealion_count_model.zip' into 'input' directory.

## Running the tests

You can run the control.py (EX. python2 control.py).

The code will show you the detection&classification result on sample images.

## Acknowledgments

This repository is being updated frequently.
